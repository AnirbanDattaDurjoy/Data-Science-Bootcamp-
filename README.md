# Data Science Bootcamp

The **Data Science Bootcamp** project is an interactive web application designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience for aspiring data scientists. This project, built using Django and Streamlit with Python, offers structured tutorials, exercises, and project-based learning to guide users through core data science topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

The goal of the Data Science Bootcamp is to create an engaging platform where users can learn data science from scratch or sharpen their skills through interactive tutorials, practice exercises, and real-world projects. The platform includes:
- Interactive lessons on data science concepts
- Practice problems and coding exercises
- Project-based learning for practical experience
- A user-friendly dashboard to track progress

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure user registration and login for a personalized learning experience.
- **Course Modules:** Structured lessons on data science topics such as Python for Data Science, Statistics, Machine Learning, and more.
- **Interactive Exercises:** Coding exercises with real-time feedback, allowing users to practice concepts learned in each module.
- **Projects & Case Studies:** End-to-end projects that apply data science skills to real-world scenarios.
- **Progress Tracking:** A dashboard for users to monitor their learning progress, completed modules, and achievements.
- **Streamlit Visualization:** Integration with Streamlit for interactive data visualizations and model simulations within the lessons.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Streamlit (for data visualizations)
- **Database:** SQLite (or specify if using another database)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnirbanDattaDurjoy/Data-Science-Bootcamp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Science-Bootcamp
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Apply migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
8. In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit server to enable visualizations:
   ```bash
   streamlit run path/to/streamlit_app.py
   ```
